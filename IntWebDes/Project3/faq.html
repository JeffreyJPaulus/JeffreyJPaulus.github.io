    	<h1>DnD Dice World FAQs</h1>
		<h2><a href="#">What are DnD Dice?</a></h2>
		<div class="faqclass">
			<p>DnD is a role playing game which uses dice as a random number generator to determine outcomes of decisions made by the 
				players as well as guide the "Dungeon Master" in determine interactions the group may encounter.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2><a href="#">Why order from us?</a></h2>
		<div class="faqclass">
			<p>Our ordering experience will provide you with the dice you need at a very competitive price.  
				As always, please reach out if you have any questions or customization requests.</p>
		</div>
		<h2><a href="#">Why all of these sides and how to use them?</a></h2>
		<div class="faqclass">
			<p>The polyhedral dice are a collection of different numbered surfaces
				d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100 sided dice 
				(although most users prefer to combine two 10's,
					one being the 10 place and the other being the ones to make a combination of 0-100 possible results.)				
			</p>
		</div>	
		<h2><a href="#">Dice Jail?</a></h2>
		<div class="faqclass">
			<p>The term Dice Jail is used for a place to put dice that have been providing poor results for the user.  
				This "Time out" is believed to help convince the dice to perform better the next use.
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2><a href="#">What are Polyhedral Dice?</a></h2>
		<div class="faqclass">
			<p>Polyheral: defined as "of pertaining to, or having the shape of a polyhedron which is a 3D object with multiple flat surfaces." from the colins dictionary.			</p>
		</div>
		<h2><a href="#">Resin vs Acrylic?</a></h2>
		<div class="faqclass">
			<p>Resin dice are typically tumbled to soften their edges. Acrylic dice are injection molded, then covered 
				all over in paint and then they go through a tumbling process to removes the paint on the outside surfaces and to polish them. 
				Acrylic are the easiest to mass produce, and therefore the lowest priced.</p>
