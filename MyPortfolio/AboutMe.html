<h1>About Jeff Paulus</h1>
<p>In my job I pull and analyze massive amounts of equipment <b>performance data</b>.  
    Through my career this has evolved from hand entered data into MS Excel to 
    learning SQL to pull from databases finishing with me developing my own 
    PostGreSQL database to combine data from multiple sources.  One of these 
    sources is hand entered data which I have been inserting through raw SQL 
    commands.  With an increasing interest in usage of this datasource, a user 
    interface is needed to enable others to interact with the data more directly 
    outside of traditional reporting tools such as Tableau and Business Intelligence.  
    Not knowing exactly how to do this, I decided to take advantage of Micron's 
    tuition assistance program and go back to school to get a foundation 
    understanding of software development.  </p>
