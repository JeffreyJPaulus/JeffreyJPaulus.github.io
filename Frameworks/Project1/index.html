    <p>
      My first experience's with coding hacking at Quick Basic on my first "laptop" which was old even then... an

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_PPC_512" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-bs-original-title="Amstrad PPC512D">Amstrad PPC512D</a>

        followed by a Mac Pascal class in Highschool.
      
      After my preliminary programming experiences, I decided to pursue a degree not in programming but the hardware running the programs which included a semester 
      learning assembly code for a Motorola processor providing great insights into "firmware".
    </p>
    <p>
      After Graduating with an AAS degree in electronics and working in various hardware related roles, I added a BS Management degree to my resume which enabled me to 
      work with people at all levels of Micron.  As my current job evolves, I am finding more of a need for software development skills as most of the hardware I support is now overseas.  While some of my past experiences have allowed me to get this far, I am 
      finding gaps in my understanding and knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      This triggered my next step in my continuous learning journey at CWI where I am pursuing an <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;"> AAS Degree in Software Development</span>. 
      The classes currently coming to an end this first semester have taught me HTML5\CSS web design as well as C# which was not only an introduction the language but also helped me grasp the concept of Object Oriented Programming.  
      I believe this alone will enable me to develop what I am currently tasked to do at work as well as enable me to fill more needed roles in the future.  I am looking forward to my next 
      classes learning additional lessons in other languages and new concepts, I am excited to continue this path towards the degree.

    <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_West"><b>US West Phone Company (Phoenix, Arizona)</b></a> 
            as a <span style="font-style: italic;">Installation Technician</span> working in the Large Business and Government Services group. 
            My primary responsibility was installing phone lines up to the demarcation point in government buildings and the larger businesses in the Phoenix area.

    <p>
        <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/"><b>Qualcomm (La Jolla, California)</b></a> 
            as a <span style="font-style: italic;">Senior Lab Technician</span> performing lab work for the software engineering group.  
            This work consisted primarily of setting up equipment including "EEBS"(Early Entry Base Stations), cabling between the EEBS and lab benches, spectrum analyzers, test boards, and the PC. 
            to enable the software engineers to run simulations for their Cell Phone software\firmware development.  Additionally I was asked to repair Cell Base Station equipment as needed.

                repairing equipment that had failed at Micron's test sites.</li>
            <br>
            <li>(Previous) <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Quality Process Engineer: </span> I was responsible for the QMS Process at the Micron Boise MFG site as well as assisting in arranging Boise site audits (Internal and External).</li>
            <br>
            <li>(Current) <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Field Service Engineer: </span> I travel to HVM (High Volume Manufacturing) sites located in Singapore, Taiwan, 
                Malaysia, China, and soon to be India supporting the same equipment I was repairing when I first started working at Micron but at a much higher level.
                I am now responsible to understand how the sites use the equipment, how it is breaking, how it can be improved on.  This requires me to travel occasionally too the HVM sites
                for hands on troubleshooting and investigation of issues but primarly I am hosting meetings with each site to review issues and remotely monitor performance and repair data to find 
                issues to address design and process related problems impacting production.  As Micron has expanded over the years, the amount of data has grown requiring new solutions.  
                To better manage this I created a Database and software to collect data for easier remote reporting.  Through this project I found gaps in my knowledge which prompted me to continue to my education at CWI for software development.</li>
