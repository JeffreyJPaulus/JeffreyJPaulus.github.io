    <h1><b>Bulma Framwork</b></h1>
 
    <p>Bulma is advertised as “The Modern CSS Framework”.  It is free, open source making it available for anyone who wants to use it.  
        Bulma is 100% Responsive meaning it is designed for mobile-first making it a heavy contender for most modern webpage designs.  
        It is advertised as Easy to download and customize as well as being Modern with Flexbox+Grid+ CSS Variables as well as an easy to use dark mode theme to match users settings.   
        It was interesting to note that the majority of the sponsorship has  been from Casinios as well as other technology companies.
        Reading through the documentation it feels a lot like Bootstrap.  I will need to experience it more to know which one I prefer although I am sure both have a place depending on the project being worked on.

        <b>Bulma breadcrumb</b> is a simple navigation component that only requires a breadcrumb contain and a “ul” list.  
        The dividers are automatically created in the content of the ::before pseudo-element of “li” tags.  
        You can inform the current page using the “is-active” modifier in a “li” tag.  It will disable the navigation of inner links.  Using breadcrumb has a very nice feel for webpage navigation which I think will be usefull in future projects.
