    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      My first experience's with coding hacking at Quick Basic on my first "laptop" which was old even then... an <a class="tooltip" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_PPC_512"
       target="_blank"> Amstrad PPC512D <span class="tooltipimage"><img src="./image/Amstrad_PPC512_open.jpg" alt="Wiki image of Amstrad"></span></a> followed by a Mac Pascal class in Highschool.
      
      After my preliminary programming experiences, I decided to pursue a degree not in programming but the hardware running the programs which included a semester 
      learning assembly code for a Motorola processor providing great insights into "firmware".
    </p>
    <p>
      After Graduating with an AAS degree in electronics and working in various hardware related roles, I added a BS Management degree to my resume which enabled me to 
      work with people at all levels of Micron.  As my current job evolves, I am finding more of a need for software development skills as most of the hardware I support is now overseas.  While some of my past experiences have allowed me to get this far, I am 
      finding gaps in my understanding and knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      This triggered my next step in my continuous learning journey at CWI where I am pursuing an <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;"> AAS Degree in Software Development</span>. 
      The classes currently coming to an end this first semester have taught me HTML5\CSS web design as well as C# which was not only an introduction the language but also helped me grasp the concept of Object Oriented Programming.  
      I believe this alone will enable me to develop what I am currently tasked to do at work as well as enable me to fill more needed roles in the future.  I am looking forward to my next 
      classes learning additional lessons in other languages and new concepts, I am excited to continue this path towards the degree.
    </p>
