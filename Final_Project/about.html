    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      My first experience's with coding started at home while in middle school using Quick Basic which happened to be included on my first "laptop" an <a class="tooltip" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_PPC_512" target="_blank"> Amstrad PPC512D <span class="tooltipimage"><img src="./image/Amstrad_PPC512_open.jpg" alt="Wiki image of Amstrad"></span></a>.  
      Once in highschool I jumped at the chance to enroll in a programming class using Mac Pascal.  
      After my preliminary programming experience and graduating highschool, I decided to pursue a degree not in programming but the hardware running the programs which also included a semester learning assembly code for a Motorola processor.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Graduating with an AAS degree and working in various hardware related roles, I decided to obtaining a BS Management degree to work at a higher level with different diverse groups.  
    </p>
    <p>
      As my current job evolves, I am finding more of a need for software development skills which I have also found I had some gaps in knowledge.  
      This triggered my next step in my Continuous Learning journey at CWI where I am pursuing an <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;"> Associate Degree in Software Development</span>. 
      The classes currently coming to an end this first semester have taught me HTML5\CSS web design as well as C# which was not only an introduction the language but also helped me grasp the concept of Object Oriented Programming.
      I believe this alone will enable me to develop what I had planned to implement for my current job as well as enable me to fill more needed roles in the future.
      Going forward towards my degree offers many additional lessons in other languages and concepts I am excited to learning more!
    </p>
